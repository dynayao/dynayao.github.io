One photonic and semiconductor researcher with the motivation to keep up with the flow.

My research interest includes artificial nanophotonic elements, especially metasurfaces. I have published more than 10 papers at the top international journals and conferences. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Kct-gIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
